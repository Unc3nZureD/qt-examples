QtWebKit
========

- Need a way to expose functions to JS that is more powerful than the current
  support for exposing the slots on a QObject. We need to be able to add
  functions directly to the window object so that we can expose methods
  directly without a containing object.

  Workaround for now: Use the evaluateJavascript facility to add a fowarding
  method written in js (yuck!).

- We also need a way to be able to expose methods that are defined at run
  time. For example if we wanted to implement something like the flash-js
  bridge where we do not know at compile time which methods should be
  available we cannot implement this using the current API.

  Not sure if we can workaround this one, though something might be possible
  if you created a metaobject on the fly.
