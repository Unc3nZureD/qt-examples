These are the examples I used in my talk at Qt Developer Days 2012, 'Using SSL
the right way with Qt'. Each provides a recipe of how to handle a common use
of the SSL support within Qt safely - connecting to the web normally, handling
user exceptions, using development servers without buying a certificate etc.

In order to setup the local test server I used during the talk, you can run
openssl like this in the tinyca directory:

openssl s_server -www -cert test.site-cert.pem -key test.site-key.pem
